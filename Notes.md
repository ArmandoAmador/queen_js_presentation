A neophytes journey in the interview world

- Experiences

Graduating from college

Having the sense of entitlement, I have a degree I should be able to find a job easily, I should be making a great salary

Problem: no real world experience, no internship experience

Ok let me apply for an internship
Problem: no experience for an internship

Dilemma: isn't that the reason I'm applying for an internship? To get more experience

Solution: do what I know temporarily, math tutor and freelance design

After cold applying and dealing with recruiters and practically giving up after 8 months post graduation, I decided to reach out to my friend

He had told me about a position, I interviewed and was offered the job

After working at that position for close to a year working there and being unhappy that same friend had told me about a position at the place he was working, I interviewed and was offered the job right away.

After having fun for 4 months, because when you do something fun it's not considered work, my friend and I were both laid off after the company was bought.

It was at this point I decided to get back into programming. After going through a web dev fellowship program and learning a ton of job ready skills I was back at a familiar place.

I know so much more than a year ago, but do not have real world experience.

I interviewed at two places where they never got back to me, but what saved me is that I had network throughout my fellowship program. I had met people and through them I had more valuable interview where they knew my current experience level and really wanted to see if I was passionate and eager to learn.

After finding a job through a great friend and mentor who took me in as a protege of sort I had the opportunity to grow tremendously as a developer and skill up.

After close of 2 years of having fun and working with an awesome group of individuals unfortunately we had to close shop and all go our separate way.

I thought this time around interviewing would be a breeze, it would be a piece of cake.

Boy was I wrong

The past three months were one of the most stressful periods I've been through since my last semester at university.

Dealing with emails, preparing my resume, fixing my linked in, getting leads, following up with leads, running out of leads, getting new leads, working with recruiters and still trying to keep up with learning and keeping a sane mind

I know many of you have heard this Phrase hundreds of time "it's not what you know, but who you know" that gets your the job. Based on my experience I would say there's half truth to that phrase. The phrase should really be "it's who you know and what you know" that gets you the job

getting leads and meeting people it's only half the battle. Once you get that interview it's really up to you to do your homework, do that extra research prepare for what may come.

Some companies do a very horrible job in job descriptions, so the best bet is to reach out to someone through your contacts or Twitter and ask them what their day to day like is.

Interview process does not start the day you get your interview, it's the day you decide to research a company

Prepare questions not only for the company to answer but for you to answer.

Always work on your craft and practice not only makes perfect but keeps you on your toes

I had the task of creating a crud app in JavaScript during a live video interview with no feedback or help from the interviewer. Not only was this a front end position but I had to either do it in angular or react. This pose a problem because I had only done angular and react for a few small components on a app. I did horrible in the interview not because I didn't know how to create one, but I was not as comfortable with either framework to do it in a pressured setting.

I was even more disappointed when I took an hour to do on my own and was able to completed with no problem.

Hence another point

Never doubt in your abilities. Always believe in yourself

When you start to believe in yourself you are able to see things in a different light, you start showing your passion for your craft, you show people your true colors you start to see what you like and don't like

Know what you want to do

Being a fullstack developer allows you to work through the stack and be able to talk both the front end and back end. That's usually perfect for agencies and smaller shops and young startups.

This does not work well for more established startups and companies. They tend to want someone who owns databases, or optimization, design, or the back end integration.

This was a problem I had to deal with. Do I need to choose a stack and go with it?




- Looking for work
- What would I do different this time around

Story

Looking for work is never a fun thing to do. Whether you have been unemployed for x amount of time, are about to be laid off or currently have a job and looking for a new place to call home.

you can say there's a shortage for developers at almost every company and many complain to find great developers it should be perfect for me to find a job since I consider myself a great developer.

Not only do I know fullstack but I can talk design I can talk scenario I can talk many different things, but lately I've been feeling like that's been a double edge sword where super early startups want me but more established companies tell me I'm too junior enough.

It is that frustration that motivated me to make this lightning talk on this neophyte journey on finding a job in this world that I seem not to master yet but approached it with a open mind and positivity.

Know what you want to do
Know where you want to work
Reach out to your network
Do not blind apply places
Do not fall in love with the first job you interview for
Do not defeat yourself
Reach out to your network again
Make your network work in your favor
Thank everyone who gave you a lending.
Improve code challenges to be used
at other interview to show things you have been learning lately

Attend meetup's
Make friends not contacts

Do not be scared to reach out to people you do not know or apply places where the job description might sound like unicorn talk

Continue practicing
