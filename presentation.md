 Story:

 Graduating from college, I thought I was prepared for the real world, I had

  - Been apart of countless clubs and organization
  - Dean and honor list countless of times
  - Held Board positions at several clubs and organizations
  - Worked in IT and design related fields for a few years for School/Campus Recreations
  - Tutored in Math and design
  - Graduated from Stony Brook University (Ranked in the top 1 percent of universities worldwide)
  - Felt Entitled
  - Partied all summer

  Obstacle: Summer ended, I need a job!

  - Cold Applying everywhere
  - Most of my contacts were in finance
  - Everyone wants to take advantage of you and get free work!
  - Still going through entitlement issues
  - Kept lying to myself on why I didn't have a job (The economy is bad, it's the summer, It's my long hair)

  After a few months I stopped being prideful and started to reach out to people and this happened

  - Started getting freelance opportunities
  - Started making more connections
  - Started tutoring in math
  - Started getting interviews
  - Got a JOB!!!
  - Disliked my JOB!!!
  - Got Another JOB!!!
  - Got Laid off (Blessing in disguise)

  Lessons Learned

  - Stop being prideful
  - Everyone you meet is a potential lead
  - Nothing is given to you, everything is earned
  - You have to pay for your mistakes
  - Learning does not end because you finish school
  - Continue to Network!


  Being Laid off was a blessing in disguise back in 2013, it was the perfect opportunity to invest in what I really wanted to do which was build the things I was designing. I wanted to get back the feeling I had the first time I build a iphone app while taking a mobile software engineering course at Stony Brook.

  I decided to dedicate all my time to coding and based on my previous networking, a friend I had met a few years back had mentioned there was a Web development fellowship being sponsored by the city and taught by Flatiron School. I applied and was accepted to a fellow cohort of 28 students. The acceptance rate was around 5-6% and I remember just going for it and not taking it personally if I didn't get accepted but I did ofcourse.

  I learn many new skills and met some great people that have become family to me. I even met my future boss and business partner at one of the events.

  After finishing the fellowship program, I was back to the dreaded interview mode. I thought I would be more ready this time around, but I was still scared of interviewing. I had a few leads from a Science fair we had hosted a few weeks prior and some leads I had gather from attending meetups.

  But I honestly didn't want to work anywhere, I wanted to build somewhat my own company. Francis had mentioned a few times that he wanted to create his own comapny and wanted to gather a few junior developers and teach them how a team of engineer should be. How to TDD/BDD, how to write features, how to write stories, how to do feature sprints, standups, retropectives. That idea of learning and building at the same time made me the right candidate to what he wanted to do.

  I still had to interview and had to do a code challenge. But it was fun. He knew how passionate I was about learning and collaborating and he was also extremely passionate abouthaving the opportunity to teach and that made the difference in the world

  After two great years there, we all decided to go out seperate ways and I was back in the Interview Journey.

  This time around I was more prepared

  - Work experience
  - Had leads
  - Felt I was having great interviews
  - 3-4 rounds at some companies, not getting past technical interview at others
  - Failing on live interview portions
  - receiving the same email from mostly every comapny to reapply in the future
  - Started doubting myself after a few weeks

  Solution

  - Whiteboarding practice
  - Practicing under pressured environment
  - Tutorials
  - Contintue working on code challenges and using them at other interviews
  - Having 2-3 projects to discuss during interviews
  - Showing more interest in the company than the stack
  - Not being afraid to interview at places where I didn't know a particular stack

## Future

 - ???
 - Continue getting better at it

## Recap of lessons learned througout my experience

 - Know What you want to do
 - Dev and Design world is too small, do not burn bridges
 - Make friends not contacts
 - Work and reach out your network
 - Don't be Afraid to Ask Questions
 - Believe in yourself
 - Be thankful/grateful for every bit of information
 - Interview starts from the moment you reach out
 - Prepare Yourself Mentally
 - Never stop practicing, always work on your craft
 - Continue learning
