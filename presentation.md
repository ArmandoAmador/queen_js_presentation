  Obstacle: Summer ended, I need a job!

  - Cold Applying everywhere
  - Most of my contacts were in finance
  - Everyone wants to take advantage of you and get free work!
  - Still going through entitlement issues
  - Kept lying to myself on why I didn't have a job (The economy is bad, it's the summer, It's my long hair)

  After a few months I stopped being prideful and started to reach out to people and this happened

  - Started getting freelance opportunities
  - Started making more connections
  - Started tutoring in math

  - Everyone you meet is a potential lead
